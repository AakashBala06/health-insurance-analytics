# Enhanced Health Insurance Claims Dashboard

This Power BI project explores synthetic health insurance claims data to uncover patterns in healthcare service usage, cost distribution, and patient risk factors. The analysis leverages claims-level records with information on procedures, diagnoses, demographic details, and total claim costs.

## Objective

To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders—such as healthcare analysts, insurers, and hospital administrators—to:

- Analyze claim cost trends across different demographics
- Identify high-cost procedures and diagnoses
- Examine the relationship between BMI, smoking status, and insurance charges
- Visualize regional and behavioral risk factors that impact healthcare costs

## Dataset

**Source:** [Enhanced Health Insurance Claims Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leandrenash/enhanced-health-insurance-claims-dataset)  
**Files Used:**
- `Cleaned_Insurance_Data.xlsx`: Preprocessed dataset used for visualization
- `Healthcare_Insurance_BMI_Smoker.pbix`: Power BI report file containing all visuals and calculated metrics

## Key Features

- **Demographic Segmentation:** Breakdown of insurance claims by age, gender, BMI, and smoking status
- **Cost Analysis:** Insights into total insurance charges and average cost per patient group
- **Risk Factor Insights:** Visual comparisons between high-risk (smoker/high BMI) vs. low-risk groups
- **Interactivity:** Slicers and filters for custom exploration by region, gender, or health behavior

## Insights

- **Smoking status is the most significant cost driver.** Smokers consistently incur higher insurance charges than non-smokers across all BMI levels and age groups.
- **Higher BMI correlates with higher charges.** There is a clear upward trend in insurance costs for patients with BMI above 30, indicating a link between obesity and healthcare expenditure.
- **Females show slightly lower average charges.** On average, female patients incur marginally lower healthcare costs than male patients in similar BMI and age groups.
- **Age is a secondary but compounding factor.** Older individuals with higher BMI and smoking status have the highest claim amounts, suggesting a compounding risk effect.
- **Regional patterns may reflect lifestyle or provider pricing differences.** Charges vary notably by region, with the Southeast having the highest average cost, potentially due to higher prevalence of smoking or obesity.
